            <h2 class="aboutme"> About <br /> Me </h2>
           
            <p>
                My digital literacy includes the design of a webpage and a booking system for a molecular
                image lab, web maintenance and the management of its messaging board for a sexual education
                site, auto imaging compilation and analytics at a neuropathic pain lab and devising 
                algorithmic excel models for research management and strategy planning. <br /> <br /> In recent years, 
                I have worked in a diverse range of positions, including research grants management, policy and 
                practice analysis and research strategy planning, across several schools and departments at the 
                university, and have increased my ability to perform assigned duties effectively and collaboratively. <br /> <br />
                With specialisation in medical anthropology, my research interests and experiences are interdisciplinary 
                and engaged in studies of culture, queer, gender/sexuality, social movements, Sinophone, history, science 
                and technology, philosophy and bioethics.  I also have an extensive background in biomedical, neuroscience 
                and human physiology research.
